    <h1>What is Source?</h1>
    <p>Source is a blockchain powered wireless network. By incentivizing every internet connected individual to share their internet access, we will not only increase the connectivity of digital consumers worldwide but also minimize the costs of wireless access and communication. We are currently building on top of the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchain, to power payments, authentication, and our registry of verified internet providers. We plan to broaden payment access to any substantial cryptocurrency out there and integrate with any blockchain platform to decentralize and build the modern networking age.</p>

      Source Network Providers
    </h2>
    <p>
      Source differentiates itself from current internet service providers by rewarding any individual who publicizes their wireless network and/or mobile device's network access. Currently, payments will be directly transferred from consumer to Source Network Provider. Eventually, payments will be closely tied and dominated by the Source Network Coin. This will establish a single standardized currency capable of purchasing internet access from any Source Network Provider, uncontrolled by any single entity and fully managed by the individuals contributing to the strength and reach of the network.

      Payment Technology
    </h2>
    <p>
      Wireless access deserves a pay-as-you-go model of transacting. Current pricing schemes are outdated, inefficient, and favor centralization of large monopolistic Internet service providers. We've chosen a blockchain architecture to take advantage of payment channel technology to facilitate fast and scalable micropayments. Essentially, it makes more sense to establish a contract with the internet provider you want internet access from only when you need internet access. You only pay for the data and bandwidth you consume. With this model, everyday consumers save money on their net internet expenses. Combined with the proliferation of Source Network Providers, internet access becomes more available for everyone in the world.

      Wireless access is a commodity. As such, a standardized currency for purchasing wireless access makes sense.
