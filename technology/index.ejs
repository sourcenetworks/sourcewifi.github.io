				<p>
					Source is a blockchain powered network for internet access. By incentivizing every internet connected individual to share their internet access, we’re not only increasing the connectivity of digital consumers worldwide but also minimizing the costs of wireless access and communication. We are currently building on top of the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchain, to power payments, authentication, and our registry of verified internet providers. We're building a platform to bring internet infrastructure into the modern age.

Payments are directly transferred from a network guest to Source Host. Payments will be closely tied to the Source Network Token. We’re establishing a single standardized token capable of purchasing internet access from any Source Host. Our network is not owned by the community uncontrolled by any single entity and fully managed by the individuals contributing to the strength and reach of the network.',

Current pricing schemes are outdated, inefficient, and favor centralization of large monopolistic Internet service providers. We‘ve chosen a blockchain architecture to take advantage of payment channel technology to facilitate fast and scalable micropayments. Essentially, it makes more sense to establish a contract with the internet provider you want internet access from only when you need internet access. You only pay for the time that you use.',
		guestSection: 'With this model, everyday consumers save money on their net internet expenses. Combined with the proliferation of Source Network Providers, internet access becomes more available for everyone in the world.

				Wireless access is a commodity. That's why we created the Source Network Token. As our network grows in value, the token grows in value. You’ll be able to purchase more internet with the same amount of token. How cool is that!			</p>

				We integrate directly with the most trusted payments providers. This allows you to allow you to fund and withdraw from within the Source app. We integrate with Coinbase and any other wallet provider, as well as traditional payments gateways with Paypal, Stripe, AliPay, and MPesa. It might seem a bit complicated, but we’ve worked out a solution so all you have to pay for is data.

With this data, you can change the physical location of your router to increase transactions. For others interested in this data, all they have to do is use Source Network Token to get access. All session initiations, session lengths, and session locations are stored. We think that this data will help hosts, researchers, and companies alike learn more about internet usage habits worldwide.
